# After-Action Review

The After-Action Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to show and review data that has been collected during and after a trial.
Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned. 
It collects messages (exchanged during trial) and shows them in a list of records. The list entries can be filtered by the user by several criteria. In addition, if an entry is selected, the details of this entry are shown.
