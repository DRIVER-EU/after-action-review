# After-Action Review

The After-Action Review (AAR) tool provides the possibility to collect data after a trial has finished and analyse it. Its main purpose is to facilitate the evaluation of the trialled solutions against the predefined objectives, and to help the participants determine how well they functioned. It collects messages (exchanged during trial), observation reports and takes screen-shots of the applications during their use.
